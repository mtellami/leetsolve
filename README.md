## ​📌​ solve some coding problems 👨🏾‍💻​

### 🔷 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
The longest common subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence that is common to all the given sequences, provided that the elements of the subsequence are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.
```c++
string s1 = "BCDAACD";
string s2 = "ACDBAC";

// Longest common subsequence: 'CDAC'
```
#### Real-world application 💡
LCS is used in a variety of contexts, such as:
- Bioinformatics: Comparing DNA sequences to identify similarities between different species or within a species.
- Text comparison: Comparing and contrasting different editions of a manuscript or different drafts of a document, allowing editors and authors to track changes and revisions.
- Version control systems: Tools like Git use LCS algorithms to identify and merge changes made in different branches of a codebase.

### 🔷 Bell numbers (BN)
The Bell Number problem is a combinatorial problem that involves calculating the Bell numbers, denoted as B(n). The Bell numbers count the number of distinct partitions of a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.
```c++
int setSize = 3;

// Number of possible subsets: 5
```
#### Real-world application 💡
Bell numbers have applications in various real-world scenarios, particularly in combinatorial and counting problems:
- Bell numbers are often used to solve combinatorial problems, such as counting the number of ways to arrange objects, distribute items into categories, or partition a set into subsets. These problems can arise in scheduling, resource allocation, and other logistical scenarios.
- The Bell numbers can help determine the number of possible ways to connect devices or components in the network. This information is valuable for optimizing network performance and reliability.
- In certain cryptographic algorithms, the Bell numbers can be used to calculate the number of possible keys or key combinations. This is important for understanding the security of a cryptographic system and the potential vulnerability to attacks.
