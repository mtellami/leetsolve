## ​📌​ solve some coding problems

### 🔷 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
The longest common subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence that is common to all the given sequences, provided that the elements of the subsequence are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.
```c++
string s1 = "BCDAACD";
string s2 = "ACDBAC";

// Longest common subsequence: 'CDAC'
```
#### Real-world application
LCS is used in a variety of contexts, such as:
- Bioinformatics: Comparing DNA sequences to identify similarities between different species or within a species.
- Text comparison: Comparing and contrasting different editions of a manuscript or different drafts of a document, allowing editors and authors to track changes and revisions.
- Version control systems: Tools like Git use LCS algorithms to identify and merge changes made in different branches of a codebase.

### 🔷 Bell numbers (BN)


- Coin change 1 (CC)
- Coin change 2 (CC2)
- Min cost path (MCP)
- Nth fibonacci number (FN)
- Subset sum (SS)
- Edit distance (ED)
- Dice throw (DT)
- Shortest common supersequence (SCS)
